####Project Title: Power BI Data Cleaning Process


### Project Overview
---
This repository showcases a data cleaning process performed in Power BI using Power Query Editor. The image provided demonstrates various transformation steps applied to a dataset to ensure it is structured and ready for analysis.

### Data Cleaning Steps
---
The following key transformations were applied:
- Transposed Table - Flipped the rows and columns to align the dataset correctly
- Removed Columns - Deleted unnecessary columns to retain relevant data.
- Removed Duplicates - Ensured unique values by eliminating duplicate rows.
- Replaced Values - Standardized data by replacing inconsistent values.
- Promoted Headers - Converted the first row into proper column headers.
- Changed Data Types - Ensured numeric and text fields were correctly formatted.
- Filled Down - Handled missing values by propagating data where necessary.
- Unpivoted Columns - Restructured the dataset for a more normalized format.

### Key Observations
---
- The dataset contains Country, Product, Attribute, and Value columns after transformations.
- The Attribute column represents years and subcategories, which were previously spread across multiple columns.
- The Value column holds numerical data, possibly sales or inventory counts.

### Why This Process is Important
---
Data cleaning is a crucial step in data analysis and business intelligence. A well-structured dataset improves:

- Data Accuracy
- Consistency
- Visualization Efficiency
- Ease of Analysis

### Future Enhancements
---
- Implementing automated scripts for repetitive cleaning tasks.
- Integrating Power BI dashboards for interactive data visualization.
